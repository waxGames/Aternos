# 🌟 Aternos & Minecraft Bot Panel

### 🚀 **Developed by Silver Team**

This project is a CMD-based control panel that allows users to run two separate `.exe` applications for managing Minecraft bots. These `.exe` files do not communicate with any server and are designed to operate independently. Additionally, one main `.exe` file can launch both applications, providing a seamless user experience.

The applications are fully compiled with no accessible source code and are available for public use under the MIT License.
